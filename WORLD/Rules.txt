Welcome to the Kingdoms if Hylancia! A new Minecraft SMP with the opportunity to play as a faction or kingdom within a wider community.

As a new player you should have received a starting pack with some materials to get yourself started!

A few comments on our vision for this server out are below. Any questions, comments, criticisms etc, please shout to Jess, Void or Cap!

All faction or kingdom type involvement is completely optional. 
If you do want to get involved, it is encouraged for players to have a distinct style of building for their own base/kingdom for any community based builds they contribute to - spawn, shopping district etc. 
It is also encouraged to have a nation type of mindset, with alliances and enemies, trade agreements, that sort of thing.

To reiterate though, this is still totally optional and effectively players can do whatever they want within server rules. 

Any alliances, prank wars, pvp dispute settlements etc can be played as much or as little as you like, and of course should be played within the rules of the server.
