Hello traveler! Welcome to the Kingdoms of Hylancia!

As you explore you will find many a varied and wonderful realm, all of which are governed and oversaw by the Hylancia Administration. 
If you linger around the admin buildings at spawn you may spy the shadowy Patrician or one of their creeping underlings going about thier business, who knows what keeps them so busy...

But do not dwell such things ! 

The world beyond the immediate is waiting for you - indeed you could settle a colony, build a new kingdom or found a faction for yourself. 

Whether solitute is your goal, or perhaps trades and barter excite you, all is possible here with the world of Hylancia. 

The administration kindly reminds you to make sure to follow the laws of the land which can be found in the ethereal pages of Discordia, as it always was.

Go forth and find your new home!
